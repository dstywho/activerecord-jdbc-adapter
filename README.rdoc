forked from @nicksieger  #YOLO

a change I need to get DataDirect's Db2 Neon Driver to work.
let me know if there is an easier way to do this.

just 1 change in RubyJdbcConnection.java:
 when looking up tables, if the catalog is empty string("")
 the catalog searched for should be left as null instead.
